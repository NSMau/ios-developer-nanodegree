# Pitch Perfect

This is the first app built on the iOS Developer Nanodegree. It's a simple app which allows an user to record their own voice (or a sound) and play it back with various sound effects, including changes to the speed, pitch, reverb, and echo.

The app has to screens. The first screen simply prompts you to record your voice. The second screen, the playback view, offers multiple altered options to play the recording back.

## Lessons Learned

By building this app, I was able to learn many concepts, such as:

- How to lay out the user interface using AutoLayout and buttons.
- How to connect UI elements to code.
- Use `ViewController` and Multiple Views to add a second screen to the app.
- Use Delegation to pass audio recordings from the first screen to the second one.
